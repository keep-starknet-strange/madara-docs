# The road towards production

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🏗">
  Madara is still at the *experimental* stage. So be cautious about going to production with such a system, thorough audits are highly recommended.
</Callout>

Madara aims to be secure *by default* and then let the responsibility to runtime engineers to ensure the changes they make keep the system secure.
That's mainly why Madara is built on secure and production-ready software such as Substrate, blockifier and cairo-rs. It already secures billion dollars of value accross different chains.
