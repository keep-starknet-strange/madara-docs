# Avail Overview

[Avail](https://www.availproject.org/) aims to provide a trust-minimized and secure base layer focused on data availability. This base layer serves as the foundation for next-generation, trust-minimized applications and blockchains.

Avail is a blockchain-based platform focused on creating a general-purpose data availability layer, addressing key challenges such as scalability, governance, and decentralization. By enabling technologies like Validiums and Sovereign Rollups, Avail allows for off-chain data availability, which significantly reduces costs and enhances efficiency.

## Key Features

- Data Blob Indexing: Avail simplifies data indexing by tying all transaction data to an application ID.

- Erasure Encoding: This adds redundancy to the data, making it harder for nodes to suppress information.

- KZG Polynomial Commitments: Ensures that the data has a footprint in the Avail block header.

- Decentralized Network of Validators: Avail aims to support up to 1,000 external validators to reduce centralization risks.

- Validity Proofs: This allows light clients to guarantee data availability and verify state execution proofs immediately after finalizing.

## Use Avail in Madara

When launching a Madara node, you can specify: `--da-layer avail`.<br></br>

This will use Avail to publish the state_diff instead of Ethereum.

When launching the node, the da-config.json file path can be provided along the `--da-conf` flag.

Also for your specific use case, you can create your app_id; check this [example](https://github.com/availproject/avail/blob/develop/examples/ts/src/app_id.ts) using TS

### Launch with local node

You can choose to launch with a local full node by following this [documentation](https://docs.availproject.org/operate/node/rpc/).<br></br>

The expected config file should look like this:

da-config.json

```json
{
  "ws_provider": "ws://127.0.0.1:9945",

  "app_id": 0,

  "validate_codegen": false, // Can be set to true for enhanced security but most likely not needed

  "seed": "//Alice" // Put a seed with some AVL tokens to publish the data
}
```

### Launch with Avail Network

You can launch directly using the up-and-running Network.<br></br>

The expected config file should look like this:

da-config.json

```json
{
  "ws_provider": "wss://goldberg.avail.tools/ws",

  "app_id": 0,

  "validate_codegen": false, // Can be set to true for enhanced security but most likely not needed

  "seed": "//Alice" // Put a seed with some AVL tokens to publish the data
}
```

### Commands

```bash

# On Avail side, after compiling/getting the binary (The ports are changed to not collide with Madara ports),

./data-avail --dev --rpc-port 9945 --port 30334

# Madara needs to be built with the Avail feature flag

cargo build --release --features avail

# On Madara side, after launching the Avail node

# First setup

./madara setup --chain=dev --from-remote --base-path=../.madara

# Launch

./madara --chain=dev --base-path=../.madara --da-layer=avail --da-conf=/home/da-config.json --force-authoring â€“alice

```
