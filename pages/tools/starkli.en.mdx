# Starkli Overview

Starkli is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline interaction with your Madara chain. It simplifies managing accounts, deploying and interacting with smart contracts, and accessing network data.

## Installing Starkli

<Steps>

### Installing starkliup

Install Starkliup, the installer for the Starkli environment

```bash

curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh

```

Starkliup should now be installed.

Restart the terminal

### Install starkli v0.1.20

Madara is currently only compatible with starkli v0.1.20. Active development is underway to ensure the latest version is supported.

Run starkliup to install starkli v0.1.20

```bash

starkliup -v 0.1.20

```

Starkli should now be installed.

Restart the terminal

### Verify Starkli installation

```bash

starkli --version

```

The output should display

```bash

0.1.20 (e4d2307)

```

</Steps>

Starkli allows you to perform all operations on your chain without leaving the command line.

## Use Starkli in Madara

Before starting with configuring Starkli, add your Madara RPC URL to the env. By default, this would be `http://localhost:9944`

```bash

export STARKNET_RPC="http://localhost:9944/"

```

### Configuring Starkli for Madara

The Starkli tutorial [here](https://book.starkli.rs/tutorials/starkli-101) should work with Madara. If you face issues

when deploying your smart contract, ensure you're Scarb `0.6.1`. You can use asdf for the same as explained [here](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf).

Also, make sure you've added the following lines in your Scarb.toml

```bash

[dependencies]

starknet = ">=2.1.0"

[[target.starknet-contract]]

```
