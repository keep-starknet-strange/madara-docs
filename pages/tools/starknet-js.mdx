# Starknet.js Overview

[Starknet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/) is a lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript library enabling interaction between your DApp and Starknet. Starknet.js allows you to interact with Starknet accounts, providers, and contracts.

## Installing Starknet.js

Follow the official Starknet.js installation instructions: https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro

## Configuring Starknet.js for Madara

Connecting to your running Madara node requires you to point your provider to the Madara RPC URL.

```javascript
const provider = new starknet.RpcProvider({
  nodeUrl: "http://localhost:9944",
});
```

You can now use this provider to interact with the chain as explained in the Starknet.js [docs](https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/guides/intro).

[Karnot](https://karnot.xyz) has also developed ready-to-use scripts using Starknet.js to fund wallets, declare and deploy contracts and some other
useful tasks. You can refer to them [here](https://github.com/karnotxyz/madara-get-started).
