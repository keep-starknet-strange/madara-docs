# Argent X Overview

[Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/) is an open-source Starknet wallet.

## Installing Argent X

Follow the official Argent X installation [instructions](https://www.argent.xyz/learn/how-to-create-an-argent-x-wallet/`).

## Use Argent X with Madara

Argent X includes the Mainnet, Sepolia, and Goerli networks by default, but connecting with your local Madara chain requires manual configuration. This involves adding a custom network within Argent X's settings.

### Configuring Argent X for Madara

<Steps>
### Open the Argent X wallet and navigate to Settings.

### Fill in the following fields:
    1. **Network Name**: A friendly name for the Madara network.
    2. **Chain ID**: The default chain ID on Madara is `SN_GOERLI`, to retrieve your chain ID or to set a custom chain ID, refer to the [Chain ID](../chain-id) section of Madara documentation.
    3. RPC URL: `http://localhost:9944`
    4. Sequencer URL: `http://localhost:9944`

### Save the new network configuration.
</Steps>

Once you have added Madara as a network, you can now connect to it.

### Deploying your Starknet wallet

Upon creation, an Argent X wallet generates a Starknet address. However, this address exists in an "undeployed" state until you initiate your first transaction.

Argent X manages the activation process under the hood; your first outgoing transaction acts as the trigger.
This transaction initiates the deployment of your smart contract on the Madara chain. This deployment incurs a one-time fee.
