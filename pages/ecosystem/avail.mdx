# Avail Overview

[Avail](https://www.availproject.org/) aims to provide a trust-minimized and secure base layer focused on **data availability**. This base layer serves as the foundation for next-generation, trust-minimized applications and blockchains.

Avail is a blockchain-based platform focused on creating a general-purpose data availability layer, addressing key challenges such as scalability, governance, and decentralization. By enabling technologies like Validiums and Sovereign Rollups, Avail allows for off-chain data availability, which significantly reduces costs and enhances efficiency.

## Key Features
- Data Blob Indexing: Avail simplifies data indexing by tying all transaction data to an application ID.
- Erasure Encoding: Adds redundancy to the data, making it harder for nodes to suppress information.
- KZG Polynomial Commitments: Ensures that the data has a footprint in the Avail block header.
- Decentralized Network of Validators: Avail aims to support up to 1,000 external validators to reduce centralization risks.
- Validity Proofs: Allows light clients to guarantee state correctness and data availability immediately after finalizing.

## Use Avail in Madara
When launching a Madara node, you can specify : `--da-layer avail`.
This will use Avail to publish the state_diff instead of Ethereum.

When launching the node da config file is expected at `<madara-path>/da-config.json` (Madara path being defaulted to `$HOME/.madara` or can be specified with `--madata-path <madara-path>`)

### Launch with local node
You can choose to launch with a local full node by following this [documentation](https://availproject.github.io/node/full-node/full-node-binaries/).
The expected config file should look like this:

_**da-config.json**_
```javascript
{
   "ws_provider": "ws://127.0.0.1:9945",
   "app_id": 0,
   "validate_codegen": true,
   "seed": "//Alice" // Put a seed with some AVL tokens to publish the data 
}
```

### Launch with Avail Network
You can launch directly using the up and running Network
The expected config file should look like this:

_**da-config.json**_
```javascript
{
   "ws_provider": "wss://kate.avail.tools/ws",
   "app_id": 0,
   "validate_codegen": true,
   "seed": "//Alice" // Put a seed with some AVL tokens to publish the data 
}
```
