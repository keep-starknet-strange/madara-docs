## Dojo: The provable games engine

### What is Dojo?
Dojo is a provable game engine with an integrated toolchain, designed for creating onchain games and autonomous worlds using [Cairo 1.0](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo). It employs an [entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) and a [diamond pattern](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), facilitating a modular, scalable world. Worlds grow via the addition of Components (state) and Systems (logic). Our architectural design is greatly influenced by the brilliant [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine.

### Dojo ❤ Madara appchains
Dojo Worlds' compatibility with any Cairo Virtual Machine (CVM) highlights Madara as its optimal platform. With an impressive throughput capacity, Madara adeptly caters to the blockspace needs of Autonomous Worlds which is vast.

> Dojo is an open-source project, currently in its early development phase, and warmly welcomes contributors. For additional resources, find the book on [Github](https://github.com/dojoengine/book).
