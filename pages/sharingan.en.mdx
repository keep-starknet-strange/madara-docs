# Sharingan

Sharingan is the name of the official testnet of Madara. This might be confusing as Madara is not a network in itself and is a framework to build your own network. So
why does it have an official testnet? Well, it's mainly to be a playground for developers to explore the capabilities of Madara and get a first hand experience of using a
Madara chain.

We've had one testnet in the past which was an overwhelming success! We had 50+ validators and full nodes running at the peak. While that version has now been sunset, we did collect
an enormous amount of feedback during its functioning. As a result, we are more than ready for a Sharingan reboot. A newer, more refined testnet with near feature compatibility
with official Starknet and tons of fixes! The Sharingan reboot will be officially hosted by [Karnot](https://karnot.xyz/). You can follow Madara on [X](https://twitter.com/MadaraStarknet) to
remain updated regarding Sharingan.# Sharingan
