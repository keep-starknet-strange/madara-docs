# Build upon Madara

*Uchiwa Madara* <br></br>In this section, we will guide you through the building process so you can start hacking on the Madara stack.
We will go from running your chain locally to changing the consensus algorithm and interacting with smart contracts on your own chain!

## Let's start

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

| Dependency  |  Version | Installation |
|---|---|---|
| Rust  | rustc 1.69.0-nightly  | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` <br></br>`rustup toolchain install nightly` |
| nvm  | latest  | `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh \| bash` |
| Cairo  | 1.0  | `curl -L https://github.com/franalgaba/cairo-installer/raw/main/bin/cairo-installer \| bash` |




### Build the chain

We will spin up a CairoVM Rollup from the Madara Stack source code. 
You could use docker images, but this way we keep the option to modify component behavior if you need to do so. 
The Madara stack source code is a monorepo which can be found [here](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara)

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:keep-starknet-strange/madara.git
```

Then let's build the chain in `release` mode

```bash
cd madara
cargo build --release
```

**Single-Node Development Chain**

This command will start the single-node development chain with non-persistent
state:

```bash
./target/release/madara --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/madara purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/madara -ldebug --dev
```

If everything works correctly, we can go to the next step and create our own genesis state!

### Create your chain specification

First, run this command to create a plain chain spec

```bash
./target/release/madara build-spec > ./infra/chain-sepcs/chain-spec-plain.json
```

By default, the chain will run with the following config :
- [GRANDPA & AURA](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/consensus/#default-consensus-models)
- An `admin` account contract at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`
- A test contract at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001111`
- A fee token (ETH) at address `0x040e59c2c182a58fb0a74349bfa4769cbbcba32547591dd3fb1def8623997d00`
- The `admin` account address has a `MAX` balance of fee token
- An ERC20 contract at address `0x040e59c2c182a58fb0a74349bfa4769cbbcba32547591dd3fb1def8623997d00`

This chain specification can be thought of as the main source of information that will be used when connecting to the chain. 

### *(Not available yet) Deploy your settlement smart contracts*

### Start your chain

Now that we are all setup, we can finally run the chain! ðŸ¥·

There are a lot of ways you can run the chain depending on which role you want to take :
- **Full node**<br></br>
Synchronizes with the chain to store the most recent block state and block headers for older blocks.
- **Archive node**<br></br>
Maintains all blocks starting from the genesis block with complete state available for every block.
- **RPC node**<br></br>
Exposes an RPC interface over HTTP or WebSocket ports for the chain so that users can read the blockchain state and submit transactions. 
There are often multiple RPC nodes behind a load balancer.
- **Validator node**<br></br>
Secures the chain by staking some chosen asset and votes on consensus along with other validators.

When developing your chain, you can simply run it in developer mode :

```bash
./target/release/madara --dev --execution=native
```

If you only care about exposing the RPC you can run the following : 
```bash
./target/release/madara --unsafe-ws-external --rpc-methods Safe --rpc-cors â€˜*â€™ --ws-max-connections 5000
```

If you want to keep the whole state of the chain in a `/tmp/ folder :
```bash
./target/release/madara --base-path /tmp/
```

In this case, note that you can purge the chain's state whenever you like by running : 
```bash
./target/release/madara purge-chain --base-path /tmp
```

### Deploy an account on your chain

Ooook, now your chain is finally running. It's time to deploy your own account!



### Make some transactions
