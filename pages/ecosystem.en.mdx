# Ecosystem

You will find under this section a curation of existing developments around Madara and clever ways in which it can be modified.
What makes Madara superior to other existing development stacks for L2/L3s is its intersection between the Starknet and Substrate ecosystem.

That means that most of existing hacks/projects/pallets that have been built for either Substrate or Starknet could be used if you're willing to build your own Madara chain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you want your custom business logic to be provable and secured by the *settlement* chain, then it needs to be written as a Cairo program.
  Thus adjusments will often need to be made on substrate pallets especially.
