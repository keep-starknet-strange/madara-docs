# Ecosystem

You will find under this section a curation of existing developments around Madara and clever ways in which it can be modified.
What makes Madara superior to other existing development stacks for L2/L3s is its intersection between the Starknet and Substrate ecosystem.

That means that most of existing hacks, projects, and pallets that have been built for either Substrate or Starknet could be used if you're willing to build your own Madara chain.

If you want your custom business logic to be provable and secured by the
_settlement_ chain, then it needs to be written as a Cairo program.
Thus adjustments will often need to be made on substrate pallets, especially.
