# Contribute to Madara

Madara has been built from day 1 in the most open-source way possible and will always follow the principles that have driven the Starknet ecosystem since day 1.

Anyone is free to join the telegram group [here](https://t.me/MadaraStarknet), come chat, ask for help, discuss anything!

Regular community calls are also organized, and you will always find the agenda in the [GitHub dicussions](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara/discussions).

Have you got an idea of an ambitious hack related to one layer of the stack ? Such as

a new DA mode or a fancy new VM ? Go ahead and create a discussion on the

GitHub repo, if all is well, you'll be invited to present it at a community call

and then start implementing it!
