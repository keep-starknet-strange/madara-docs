Regular community calls are also organized which you will always find the agenda in the [GitHub dicussions](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara/discussions).

  Have an idea of an ambitious hack related to one layer of the stack ? Such as a new DA mode or a fancy new VM ?
  Go ahead and create a discussion on the GitHub repo, if all good you'll be invited to present it at one community call and then start implementing it!
