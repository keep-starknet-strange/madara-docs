# Running Madara with the `--dev` flag
The --dev flag runs a development mode within Madara, offering several advantages for streamlining the app chain development process.
Some of these features include the provision of pre-funded, pre-deployed accounts available when launching the chain.

These are enumerated when starting an app chain:
- Address: `0x1` with no PK
- Address: `0x2` with PK as `0xc1cf1490de1352865301bb8705143f3ef938f97fdf892f1090dcb5ac7bcd1d`
- Address: `0x2` with PK as `0xc1cf1490de1352865301bb8705143f3ef938f97fdf892f1090dcb5ac7bcd1d`
- Address: `0x4` with no PK (any string can be used as the PK)

These accounts can be directly plugged into your dev use cases. Since they're pre-deployed you can sign any transaction with them as well.

These accounts can also be used to fund your personal Madara wallet, an example of this is faucet.js

```javascript
const provider = new starknet.RpcProvider({
  nodeUrl: "http://localhost:9944", // initialises the provider with the Madara RPC node URL
});

const account = new starknet.Account(
  provider,
  "0x4", // 0x4 is one of the predeployed accounts
  "0x1234", // Any valid string can be passed as the private key for the 0x4 address
  "1", // "1" is an identifier for Cairo 1.0 accounts
);

async function transfer(to) {
  const contract = new starknet.Contract(ERC20.abi, eth_address, provider);
  let result = contract.populate("transfer", {
    recipient: to,
    amount: {
      low: 1e20,
      high: 0,
    },
  });

  let hash = await account.execute(result, undefined);
}
```
[Karnot](https://karnot.xyz) has also developed ready-to-use scripts using Starknet.js to fund wallets, declare and deploy contracts and some other
useful tasks. You can refer to them [here](https://github.com/karnotxyz/madara-get-started).
